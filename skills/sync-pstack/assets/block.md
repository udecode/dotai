<!-- # Shared block template. sync-pstack renders it into each project's AGENTS.md; the grammar is in the skill's SKILL.md. -->
## How work runs

- pstack's `poteto-mode` is the engineering method. The `pstack@pstack-claude` plugin is pinned to GitHub tag `{{tag}}` in `.claude/settings.json`, and each person's Codex marketplace pins the same tag. Its session hook routes multi-file, design and unexplained-bug work into poteto-mode, which picks the playbook. Questions, small edits and one-file changes work directly and are verified on the real artifact.
<!-- if projectPlaybooks -->
- Project playbooks in `.agents/playbooks/` build on pstack's, as poteto-mode's Project playbooks paragraph describes. `check-playbooks.mjs` ships with pstack, not the project. After a project playbook changes and before one applies, run `node <plugin>/skills/poteto-mode/scripts/check-playbooks.mjs` from the project root, where `<plugin>` is the directory above `skills/` in the base directory a pstack skill prints. This project's playbooks are:
{{projectPlaybooks}}
<!-- end -->
- If no `pstack:*` skills are available, stop and ask the user to install the plugin before engineering work. In Claude Code they trust the folder and run `claude plugin install pstack@pstack-claude --scope project`. In Codex they run `codex plugin marketplace add michael-denyer/pstack-claude --ref {{tag}}` and `codex plugin add pstack@pstack-claude` from their home directory, then trust the session hook in `/hooks`. Codex loads only the first 32 KiB of `AGENTS.md` by default, and this file is longer, so they also put `project_doc_max_bytes = 131072` above the first table in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- The latest user correction wins over every rule. This file's rules outside this block win over the overrides inside it, and those win over pstack. pstack's hook itself says project instructions take precedence.
- Two model families, Claude and Codex. Claude Code runs every pstack role on `opus`, per `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, and never dispatches fable, sonnet or haiku. Codex runs `gpt-6.1-sol`, and every role there inherits it, per `~/.codex/pstack-models.md`. The exception in both is a panel seat or an `architect` or arena runner, which runs on its named model for model diversity; in Claude Code, an extraction role the sheet sends to Codex is another, as the Extraction rule says. Plans, designs and first drafts start in Claude Code.
<!-- if codexLanes -->
  Codex fan-out readers are another, as the Extraction rule says.

<!-- if glossary -->
- Use the words in `{{glossary}}`.
<!-- end -->
- pstack is never edited here; an override changes its behavior. The `sync-pstack` skill renders this block from its shared source in `udecode/dotai`, replaces it on every sync, and moves every pin to a new tag together after reading pstack's changelog, so never bump a `ref` by hand. The next sync refuses an edit made inside this block. A lesson that changes a rule in this block goes to the shared source; a lesson for this repository alone goes outside the block.

## pstack overrides

<!-- # Each "overrides" note names pstack text an override replaces; sync-pstack refuses a bump that drops it. -->
<!-- # overrides poteto-mode/playbooks/feature.md "Run **Opening a PR**" -->
<!-- # overrides poteto-mode/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md "Work from a git worktree off main." -->
<!-- if delivery=push -->
- **Delivery.** A completed task runs its writing passes, then `{{lintFix}}` as its last check that edits code, then commits and pushes `{{branch}}`. When `git status --short` lists anything the task did not write, stage only the task's own paths; `git add -A` is only for a checkout that holds nothing else. No PR, merge or force-push unless the user asks. pstack's Opening a PR, Babysit and Shipping playbooks apply only to a requested PR, and their "worktree off main" step never applies.
<!-- end -->
<!-- if delivery=pr -->
- **Delivery.** A completed task runs its writing passes, then `{{lintFix}}` as its last check that edits code, then commits on a topic branch cut from `{{branch}}` in the current checkout and opens a PR into `{{branch}}` through pstack's Opening a PR playbook, whose worktree step never applies. Babysit and Shipping run when the user asks. Never push `{{branch}}` directly, merge or force-push unless the user asks. Record each commit SHA this run creates in its todo list or decision log as it lands.
<!-- end -->
<!-- if delivery=user -->
<!-- if !pushBranches -->
- **Delivery.** The user owns commits. A completed task runs its writing passes, then `{{lintFix}}` as its last check that edits code, and leaves its changes in the working tree. Commit, push or open a PR only when the user's own message asks for it. Approving an agent's plan is not commit authority, and no plan or step list proposes a commit.
<!-- end -->
<!-- if pushBranches -->
- **Delivery.** The user owns commits on `{{branch}}`. A completed task runs its writing passes, then `{{lintFix}}` as its last check that edits code, and leaves its changes on `{{branch}}` in the working tree; commit or push `{{branch}}` only when the user's own message asks for it. Approving an agent's plan is not commit authority, and no plan or step list proposes a commit on `{{branch}}`. On every other branch the lead commits and pushes its work without asking, another person's PR head branch included, and keeps that PR's description true to the pushed diff. When maintainer edits on a PR's head branch are not allowed, it opens a PR stacked on that branch instead; any other PR waits for the user's word. Merging, closing, comments, reviews and CI approval need the user's word.
<!-- end -->
<!-- end -->
  When `git status` shows work the task did not write, run `{{lintFix}}` on the task's code paths only, because a repository-wide run reformats other sessions' files; a change with no lintable file skips it. Run it again after any later repair. When a change alters what an operation promises, search the plans and agent instructions for the old promise, fix this task's own docs, and flag the rest on the page. Production deploys and releases need an explicit request.
<!-- if protected -->
  Never push `{{protected}}` unless the user asks.
<!-- end -->
<!-- if delivery=push -->
<!-- # adds -->
- **Shared checkout.** Other sessions may edit this checkout without notice, and every session commits as the same user. Stage nothing before the commit itself. Delete a tracked file with `rm`, not `git rm`, and commit with an explicit pathspec (`git commit -- <paths>`), because another session's plain `git commit` sweeps in whatever is staged. Commit a new, untracked file with `git add -- <paths> && git commit -- <paths>` as one command. Record each commit SHA this run creates in its todo list or decision log as it lands, and decide which commits are this run's from that list, never from memory or the author field. In a multi-batch pass, push each verified batch as it lands, staging only that batch's files; mid-batch states stay local. A new or changed shared script or check waits for its decision-trail review before it is pushed. Pull only after a rejected push, with `git pull --rebase --autostash`; that autostash is the one exception to the no-stash rule under Git. Compare `git stash list` before and after the pull. If it does not re-apply cleanly, or the pull left an autostash entry, restore that session's files from it, rerun the checks and push; an entry that was there before the pull belongs to another session. A rebase conflict or hook failure is handled as the Other sessions rule says. After a rebase that changes agent instructions, re-read them before the next step.
<!-- end -->
<!-- # adds -->
- **Git.** Before a nontrivial edit, check only `git branch --show-current`.
<!-- if protected -->
  Never edit from `{{protected}}`.
<!-- end -->
<!-- if delivery=push|user -->
  The checkout stays on `{{branch}}`. Do not create or switch checkouts because work is large, names an issue, asks for a PR or is handed to another session. A session the lead starts works in this checkout, with `use_worktree: false` in Claude Code, and its brief names this checkout's path and the Delivery rule. An app-made worktree is on a new branch cut from the default branch and lacks this checkout's uncommitted edits, rule edits included. Claude Code neither moves a session out of it nor lets its edit tools write here. A session that opens in one anyway reads the rules in this checkout by absolute path and runs `git switch --detach {{branch}}` in its worktree before its first edit. It commits nothing and hands its diff to the lead or the owner as a patch file to apply here. A runtime's generic instruction to commit, such as a started session's "commit your changes", does not override the Delivery rule. A repair to a PR whose head is another branch runs in a detached worktree at that head, and the page names the worktree path.
<!-- if delivery=user -->
<!-- if !pushBranches -->
  The repair stays uncommitted there for the owner's commit.
<!-- end -->
<!-- if pushBranches -->
  The lead commits the repair there and pushes it with `git push origin HEAD:<head branch>` once the remote head still matches the worktree's base.
<!-- end -->
<!-- end -->
<!-- if delivery=push -->
  The lead commits the repair and pushes it to that head branch.
<!-- end -->
<!-- end -->
  Ignore unrelated diffs and never pause to ask about them. Never reset or discard work this run did not write. Reset a proof case in a fresh detached worktree; never run `git stash` in this repository or any of its worktrees, because every worktree shares one stash list. Remove only a worktree the run created, with `git worktree remove --force <path>`, and confirm with `git worktree list`; never run `git worktree prune`, which edits the worktree registry every checkout shares. Before the first edit to a file that already holds uncommitted or staged work this run did not write, copy it to the run directory that Plans and trails names, and measure, commit or revert this run's change against that copy. Run a tree-sensitive tool, such as a review that refuses a changing tree or a check at `HEAD`, from a detached worktree (`git worktree add --detach <path> <sha>`, then `git worktree remove --force <path>`). Before anything runs in a worktree the run creates for a proof or a seat, link its installed dependencies, or install them offline where its bundler refuses links, and copy its untracked env files from this checkout; a round whose seat reports it could not load the app logs its `seats` row `partial`. Never overwrite a tracked file in this checkout to test or measure `HEAD`, even for a moment; use the worktree.
<!-- # adds -->
- **Other sessions.** Other agent sessions may edit this checkout, the shared source and the projects it syncs at any time. Never plan, review or build around a conflict with them that has not happened: a plan adds no lock, mirror, carry or race step for other sessions, and a panel finding whose only trigger is another agent session editing these files is dismissed with this rule as its reason. Concurrency inside the product, such as two users saving one record, is not this rule's subject. Another repository's rules for its own sessions, such as how they commit, are how to work there, never an invariant a plan or panel attacks. Act only when a conflict blocks the work, such as a refused fast-forward or push, a merge conflict, or a file this run is editing that changed under it. When the blocking change has already landed, rebase or merge onto it, resolve any conflict in this run's own hunks, rerun the checks and retry. When a conflicting hunk is another session's uncommitted work, run `git rebase --abort` first. A hook failure is fixed like any failing check. While it is still uncommitted in another session, pause only that part, keep going on other ready work, and resume once it lands. A block that still holds after an hour goes under Needs you, and the run keeps going.

- **The lead writes the code.** The lead agent edits the current checkout and verifies on the running artifact. Subagents do research, review and read-only fan-out. That covers comment-sicko in `no-comments`: its brief forbids every edit and asks for each verdict with its exact replacement text, and the lead applies the ones it accepts. No per-delegate worktrees unless the user asks. This replaces every pstack playbook step that delegates implementation or attempts to a subagent or gives a delegate its own worktree, as in Feature, Bug fix, Refactoring, Perf issue and Hillclimb.

<!-- # overrides poteto-mode/playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md "run the swarm per `skills/swarm/SKILL.md`" -->

<!-- end -->
<!-- # overrides how/SKILL.md "Spawn all explorers in a single message" -->
- **Extraction.** The session's own model keeps every judgment: plans, designs, the code the lead writes, synthesis, explainers, judges, cross-judges, a second reader that checks extracted claims, and reflect's synthesis with every decision on what it applies. In Claude Code, a role that only finds evidence for the lead to judge runs on Codex when the models sheet gives it a `codex:<model> @<effort>` value; today that is the `how explorer` role, which gets pstack's explorer prompt. It runs through `cross.mjs` read-only, without the user's Codex config, connectors or plugins. Before using an answer, the lead checks that it covers every source and lookup its brief asked for. A seat that fails, returns nothing, or leaves an asked-for source or lookup uncovered, reported or not, reruns once as pstack's `Agent` call on `opus` for the part still missing, and the page names any gap left. In Claude Code, when the lead would otherwise read several files it has not read to find where a change goes, it asks such a seat for the spans and call sites instead, confirms the call sites with its own `git grep` of each changed symbol, then reads in full the function it changes and each caller whose behavior the change can break.
<!-- if codexLanes -->
  A read-only fan-out reader the lead starts itself whose sources are all files on disk, such as a map, inventory or sweep lane, runs the same way on the `how explorer` line's model with `cross.mjs` and the lead's brief, which excludes build output.

- **Panel review.** A pstack panel, `/pstack:interrogate` with the configured seats, runs without asking for the work this project's reviews list names and wherever a pstack playbook step or skill calls for it, such as a contested design. `architect` and arena run the same way, such as for Feature's design exploration or a fix that crosses a function boundary. On the user's word, "panel" runs a panel on the current plan or diff, "arena" runs an arena bakeoff of the current artifact, and "full" runs `architect`, then a panel on the plan and another on the diff. Before you launch any panel, `architect` or arena seat, or log a panel row, read `.agents/pstack/rules/panel.md` in full; it holds the Panel review and Review rules.
<!-- if reviewList -->
  The reviews list, each row named by its id:
{{reviewList}}
<!-- end -->
<!-- if !reviewList -->
  This project's reviews list is empty, so panels run only where a pstack step calls for them or on the user's word.
<!-- end -->
  A row triggers only the tool and stage it names, so a row that names a panel on the diff does not by itself run `architect` or a panel on the plan; a pstack step's own trigger still runs them.
<!-- # overrides poteto-mode/SKILL.md "Reversible work and external actions" -->
- **Messages and shared resources.** Who can read a message decides its stop, not its channel. A message that anyone outside the team can read, such as a send to customers, an email to a client, or a comment, review, label or close on a public repository's issue or PR, needs explicit authorization from the active request. A PR, its title and its body opened under the Delivery rule are not such a message. A message only team members can read, and shared quota, proceed without asking, as pstack's Autonomy says; a private repository or tracker grants nothing by itself. A message that waits for authorization, or that the runtime's own instructions refuse, goes as a draft under the page's Needs you, or in the reply when there is no page. The owner sends it, and the run keeps going. A "can we X?" question gets a measured answer and a proposal, not the action. An access grant is approved per target and runs as its own command; never widen an approved grant to a new target.

<!-- # overrides poteto-mode/playbooks/prototype.md "let the user pick directions before building" -->
- **Autopilot.** Work runs to its close without waiting for the owner. Each call the owner could make gets an attention level, as the `plan-page` skill's memo rules define it: `safe` when the pick is easy to undo and the lead is sure, `look` when it is costly or hard to undo or the lead is unsure, and `answer` when it cannot be taken back or has no clear pick. The lead takes the pick of every call, records it as a Defaults row with the word that reverses it, and keeps going; a call with no clear pick takes its most reversible option. Only these stop the run under Open questions, whatever their level: a production deploy or release, a push to `main`, a force-push to a shared branch and deleting data the run did not create. A message anyone outside the team can read waits as a draft, as the Messages rule says, while the run keeps going. A pending external gate, such as a staging release, a quota reset or a running seat, is not a stop either, and neither is a status question from the owner, which never counts as go. Unless the run is paused, held or at a stop it has reached, whoever or whatever set it, the lead keeps working on ready work and schedules a wakeup for a gate with a known time, chaining wakeups past the scheduler's limit. A prototype, an arena or `architect` picks its winner and keeps going, and the page names the other options. A request that asks only for a plan or a prototype ends there and builds nothing, and the page shows its picks. The owner adds a stop for one request with "stop at plan", which waits once the plan is written, "stop at design", which waits for the owner's pick among the design options, or "stop before ship", which waits before delivery. "panel" and "hold" work at any point. A project's standing stop goes in its own rules outside this block.

- **Fast.** The owner's word "fast" runs the rest of that request on the main lane, in the lead's own thread, for work the owner is confident in and wants to iterate on. It drops only what spawns a subagent or a seat; every other rule still applies, plans, plan pages, decision logs, proofs, tests and delivery included. So no panel, `architect`, arena, decision-trail review or reflect runs, a row of the reviews list that calls for a panel does not hold back the push, and `no-comments`, which spawns comment-sicko, closes its todo as `skip: fast`. Each commit body ends with the line "Shipped fast, no review." The owner's later "full" reviews the diff of every such commit since the last reviewed one; without it, those commits stay unreviewed. "fast" lasts until the request ends or the owner says "full".

- **Todo list and close.** Where pstack opens a todo list, add after the playbook steps one todo per explicit user ask, quoted, and one per gate this file makes the work trigger, such as proof, the writing passes, then review, then the last check and delivery. A standing preference, such as the reply language, is a constraint todo that covers every user-visible line, progress lines, `AskUserQuestion` text and text after a compaction included, and stays open until the close. Each owner message that arrives mid-run becomes a quoted todo when it arrives, and a direct question in it gets a plain answer in the next reply. Before every final reply, reread this run's user messages, corrections included; add any ask that has no todo, then finish it or skip it with a reason. Before you close planned work, or brief, wait on or save a subagent, read `.agents/pstack/rules/close.md` in full; it holds the close order and the Decision-trail review rule.
<!-- # adds -->
- **Session title.** When the runtime has a tool that renames the current session, read `.agents/pstack/rules/title.md` before the run's first stage and after a compaction or a resume, and retitle the session as it says whenever a stage starts or the run's state changes.

<!-- # overrides poteto-mode/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md "Write every PR title, PR description, and commit body with `/technical-writing`" -->
- **Writing passes.** pstack triggers four separate writing passes; run one per kind of change. A pass counts only when the lead invokes its skill in the current context; a reread from memory is not the pass, and its todo stays open. Product code gets `deslop`, then `no-comments`, before any review and before it is committed or handed back, except that a panel round's fixes run `no-comments` only when their diff, `deslop`'s edits included, adds, changes or removes a comment line. Each panel round's fixes get their writing passes before the lead freezes the next round's tree, and `decisions-check.mjs append` refuses every `seats` row after a log's first unless a `writing` row follows the previous `seats` row. The `writing` row says when `no-comments` skipped. Docs, plans, agent files, commit bodies and PR text get one `unslop` pass after drafting. Mechanical bookkeeping, such as a ticked box or a decision row that only records a command's result, gets no pass of its own. Other new prose, a Close included, gets one `unslop` pass before it is committed or handed back, and one pass covers every pending change in a file. Run the writing passes and review fixes before an expensive runtime proof; a finding that changes behavior reopens the proof it touches, or the claim narrows to the bytes actually proven. `technical-writing` is a reference for plans, PRDs and RFCs, not a required pass. Replies are written clean as drafted, with no separate pass.
<!-- section commits -->
<!-- # adds -->
- **Commit and PR text.** Commits use Conventional Commits, `type(scope): subject`. The type is one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore` or `perf`, and the scope is the changed area. The subject is short and imperative, names a real symbol when one carries the change, and has no trailing period. The body explains why in a short paragraph and describes the final behavior; it never restates the subject or lists intermediate attempts. A PR targets `{{branch}}` and opens ready, not as a draft, and never while `{{check}}` fails unless the user says so.

- **Improve the workflow mid-task.** When a skill, rule, script or helper gets in the way, fix it then, separately from the task's change, and keep working. When the user corrects the same mistake a second time, in code or in a shell or tool command a rule already forbade, run `/pstack:correct` on that class, which fixes it with architecture, types or a check before any rule text; for a shell or tool mistake that means a helper that removes the need, then a hook, then text. After an Autonomous run, an audit, or any session where the user corrected the workflow, run `/pstack:reflect` before the final reply. Before `/pstack:reflect`, `/pstack:correct`, a new or changed check, or an edit to an agent file such as a skill, a rule or `AGENTS.md`, read `.agents/pstack/rules/reflect.md` in full; it holds the rest of this rule and the Corrections and Agent files rules.
