# .ai

This folder contains AI-assisted development tools for improving code quality and consistency.

## How to use?

- Click on the "Use this template" button
- Create a `.ai` folder in your repository
- Move the content of this template into the `.ai` folder

### Or just use it on an existing one!

- You can quick import this project and keep watching the community adding a submodule.
- the command create a submodule and also the `.ai` folder.
- ```bash
  git submodule add git@github.com:udecode/dotai.git .ai
  ```

## Codex

### Files

- [codex.md](codex/codex.md): AI Codex - A repository of learnings and errors.
- [learn.md](codex/learn.md): AI Learn - Protocol for updating the AI Codex.

### Usage

1. Review the Codex: [codex.md](codex/codex.md) (silent load, no output)
2. Update the Codex: [learn.md](codex/learn.md)

### Important Note

[codex.md](codex/codex.md) should be added to the context of every chat:

- For regular chats: Use the plus button at the top of the chat to add the file.
- For Composers: Add the file to a Project Composer so all Composers created in that project will automatically have the file.

### Structure

The [Codex](codex/codex.md) is divided into two main sections:

1. Errors: Mistakes made and how to prevent them.
2. Learnings: Insights gained and their applications.

Each entry includes context, description, correction/application, and related entries.

## Snippets

Snippets include code templates that AI can use to generate or refactor code. They help in writing shorter prompts for better results.

- [create-snippet.md](snippets/create-snippet.md): Prompt for creating new snippets

## Session

- [start-session.md](session/start-session.md): Initiates a new AI session
- [end-session.md](session/end-session.md): Concludes the current AI session

Session files create a "memory layer" for the AI across multiple interactions, enabling contextual awareness and adaptive assistance.

Key benefits:

- Maintains project context between sessions
- Reduces repetition of project details
- Provides consistent guidance aligned with project direction

Usage:

1. End a session: Use [@end-session](session/end-session.md) command
2. Start a new session: Use [@start-session](session/start-session.md) command

The AI will generate and read status files in [status](status) to maintain project continuity.

## Blueprints

Blueprints are comprehensive guides for implementing specific technical architectures or project setups. They provide step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and integrating various technologies to create a functional foundation for your project.

- [supabase-drizzle-actions.md](blueprints/supabase-drizzle-actions.md): Backend architecture with Supabase, Drizzle ORM, and Server Actions
- [flux-with-replicate.md](blueprints/flux-with-replicate.md): Image generation using Flux and Replicate

## Libraries

- [lib](lib): Contains documentation examples for library usage

## Plugins

### v0

- [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) is a tool for generating React components from screenshots and chat. Currently, they don't have a Cursor plugin, so you can use [v0](v0/v0.md) bridging prompt.
- [v0.md](v0/v0.md): Guide for using v0.dev to generate component ideas and prompts

## Rules of AI

[Rules](rules) contains rules for default AI behavior and interaction. These rules are meant to be added to the global "Rules of AI" setting.
